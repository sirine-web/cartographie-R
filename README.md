# cartographie-R
The code is using R programming to create a map of Tunisia showing the average number of visits to monuments in each government region. The code first loads several libraries including maptools, sp, shapefiles, geodata, dplyr, and raster. The geodata library is used to load geographic data for Tunisia. This data is grouped by government region and the average number of visits is calculated. The data is then plotted on a map using the fdc geographic data and symbols representing the average number of visits in each region. The map is titled and a legend is added to show the size of the symbols used on the map.
